# Space-Invaders
Hello world! In this project I tried out Unity and implementing machine learning to a game! The game if choice being... Space Invaders! ðŸ‘¾âœ¨ 


To play the game open up the project in [Unity](https://unity.com/download) and start! 

For the machine learning agent the important scripts are Player.cs and BulletCollision.cs
