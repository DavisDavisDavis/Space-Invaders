# Space-Invaders
Hello world! In this project I tried out Unity and implementing machine learning to a game! The game if choice being... Space Invaders! üëæ‚ú® 


## Lets train! ‚ö°Ô∏è
So to train the machine learning agent, first open up the project in [Unity](unity.com/download). Then install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [ml-agents]() python package. Following this [installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Installation.md) is highly recommended. I know it is a lot of prerequisites but it will totally be worth it! Now start up the ml-agents python API by entering ``lalalla`` from the TrainingConfig directory. Then stat the game and the agent will start training. üò≤ 

For the machine learning agent the important scripts are Player.cs and BulletCollision.cs
